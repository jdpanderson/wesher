# cheesecloth

cheesecloth builds a private mesh network between a small number of machines using
[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/). It is meant for people who run a few servers or home machines and want them
to reach each other securely without much setup. Every node connects directly to every other node over an encrypted
tunnel. Each node gets a fixed private address and a hostname entry. Nodes find each other again after a restart
without any intervention. There is no central server and no shared password. A new machine is added with an
invitation token and removed with a single command.

Someone observing can see that you run cheesecloth and which nodes are talking to each other. The public addresses,
the ports, the timing of packets and the protocol names in the connection setup are all visible. Everything else is
encrypted: node names, identities, keys, the invitation exchange, and all traffic between the nodes.

## Quickstart

cheesecloth runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. On Linux it uses the kernel's WireGuard, which is in Linux 5.6 and
later, and runs WireGuard itself where the kernel has none. On macOS and Windows it always runs WireGuard itself.
Two UDP ports must be open between the nodes: 51820 for WireGuard and 7946 for cheesecloth. The commands below are
for Linux; the other platforms are described in [operations](docs/operations.md#platforms).

1. Download the binary on every node:

   ```
   $ wget -O cheesecloth https://github.com/jdpanderson/cheesecloth/releases/latest/download/cheesecloth-$(go env GOOS)-$(go env GOARCH)
   $ chmod a+x cheesecloth
   ```

2. On the first node, start a cluster:

   ```
   ./cheesecloth --init

   # Or customize the interface name, and the overlay network the cluster allocates addresses in
   # ./cheesecloth --init --interface wghomelab --overlay-net 10.42.0.0/24
   ```

3. On the same node, create an invitation for the next node:

   ```
   ./cheesecloth invite
   7xk3...
   valid for 10m0s, 1 use(s). On the new node:
     cheesecloth --join <this host> --join-key 7xk3...
   ```

4. On the new node, run the command from the invitation:

   ```
   ./cheesecloth --join first.example.net --join-key 7xk3...

   # If you customize the interface name, you might want to use it on the joined hosts
   # ./cheesecloth --join first.example.net --join-key 7xk3... --interface wghomelab
   ```

The two nodes are now connected. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each additional node; the invitation can be created on
any node that is already a member. After the first start, a node needs neither `--join` nor `--join-key`: it resumes
from what it saved. `cheesecloth status` lists the peers. `cheesecloth revoke NAME` removes another node, and
`cheesecloth leave` removes the node it runs on. Running
cheesecloth as a system service is described in [operations](docs/operations.md).

A node does still need the settings it runs with, on every start, with one exception: `--overlay-net` comes from the
cluster. The member that admits a node tells it which network the cluster allocates addresses in, and the node keeps
it, so only the node that starts a cluster is given one. `--wireguard-port` must be the same across the cluster;
`--cluster-port` need not be, though a member listening on another one has to be named as `host:port` in `--join`.
`--interface` is local: each node names its interface what it likes, but that name has to be given to `invite`,
`revoke` and `status` on that node, since they find the agent by it. Rather than repeat them, most setups put them in
`/etc/cheesecloth/config.yaml` once, after which every command runs with no arguments:

```yaml
interface: wgmesh
```

[`dist/config.yaml`](dist/config.yaml) is an annotated example, and [configuration](docs/configuration.md) describes
every option.

## How it works

Each node has a permanent identity, which is an Ed25519 key pair generated on its first start. Membership is a list
of signed admission records. The node that ran `--init` is the root and signs its own record. To admit a new node, an
existing member signs a record for it. Any node can verify a record by following the signatures back to the root.
There is no cluster-wide key. If a node is compromised, the attacker obtains that node's identity only, and any member
can revoke it.

New nodes are admitted with an invitation. `cheesecloth invite` creates a random token that is kept in memory on the
inviting node until it is used or expires. The new node and the inviting node each prove to the other that they know
the token. The inviting node then signs the admission record and both nodes discard the token. The admission record
also assigns the new node the lowest unused address in the overlay network, so every node computes the same address
for every member and the address does not change across restarts.

Nodes communicate over QUIC on a single UDP port and use [memberlist](https://github.com/hashicorp/memberlist) to
track membership and detect failed nodes. Each connection is a TLS 1.3 session in which both sides present a
certificate for their identity, and a connection is accepted only if the peer is a current member. Over these
connections each node announces its WireGuard public key, which is regenerated on every start, its overlay address,
and any networks it routes. The announcement is signed with the node's identity. Peers check it against the admission
records and then configure the WireGuard interface: peer keys, endpoints, allowed IPs, routes and `/etc/hosts`
entries are updated whenever the membership changes.
